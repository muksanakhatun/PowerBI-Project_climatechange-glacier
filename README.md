# climate change and it's effect on ice sheet

A warmer climate affects ice sheets in several ways. The most evident impact observed to date is a loss of ice due to warmer air and ocean waters. Warmer air causes the ice to melt more quickly and flow more rapidly to the sea, especially in low-elevation regions near the edges of the ice sheets.
Fossil fuel consumption has increased significantly over the past half-century, around eight-fold since 1950, and roughly doubling since 1980.

Fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) have, and continue to, play a dominant role in global energy systems.
But they also come with several negative impacts. When burned they produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and are the largest driver of global climate change.But the types of fuel we rely on has also shifted, from solely coal towards a combination with oil, and then gas. Today, coal consumption is falling in many parts of the world. But oil and gas are still growing quickly.

- Sea surface temperature is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean's surface.This is measured at a nominal depth of 20cm, and given relative to the average temperature.
- Arctic sea ice measured in September, when it reaches its minimum each year.
- Cumulative mass balance of U.S. reference glaciers, relative to the base year 1965. This is given in meters of water equivalent, which represent
changes in the average thickness of a glacier.
- This metric measures the average area covered by snow, averaged over an entire year based on an analysis of weekly maps. These data cover all of North America (not including Greenland).
- Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration is measured in parts per million (ppm).
- Atmospheric methane (CH₄) concentration is measured in parts per billion (ppb).
- Atmospheric nitrous oxide (N₂O) concentration is measured in parts per billion (ppb)

# climate change and it's effect on ice sheet

A warmer climate affects ice sheets in several ways. The most evident impact observed to date is a loss of ice due to warmer air and ocean waters. Warmer air causes the ice to melt more quickly and flow more rapidly to the sea, especially in low-elevation regions near the edges of the ice sheets.
Fossil fuel consumption has increased significantly over the past half-century, around eight-fold since 1950, and roughly doubling since 1980.

Fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) have, and continue to, play a dominant role in global energy systems.
But they also come with several negative impacts. When burned they produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and are the largest driver of global climate change.But the types of fuel we rely on has also shifted, from solely coal towards a combination with oil, and then gas. Today, coal consumption is falling in many parts of the world. But oil and gas are still growing quickly.

# Climate Change and It's Effect On Ice Sheet

A warmer climate affects ice sheets in several ways. The most evident impact observed to date is a loss of ice due to warmer air and ocean waters. Warmer air causes the ice to melt more quickly and flow more rapidly to the sea, especially in low-elevation regions near the edges of the ice sheets.

Fossil fuel consumption has increased significantly over the past half-century.Fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) have, and continue to, play a dominant role in global energy systems.But they also come with several negative impacts. When burned they produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and are the largest driver of global climate change. Which cause to increase both air and ocean surface temperature.

I have used *****Power BI***** to create and intereactive dashboard which shows how sea **surface temperature is increasing and snow cover, U.S. Glaciers, ice sheet are decreasing.**

- Sea surface temperature is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean's surface.This is measured at a nominal depth of 20cm, and given relative to the average temperature.
- Arctic sea ice measured in September, when it reaches its minimum each year.
- Cumulative mass balance of U.S. reference glaciers, relative to the base year 1965. This is given in meters of water equivalent, which represent
changes in the average thickness of a glacier.
- This metric measures the average area covered by snow, averaged over an entire year based on an analysis of weekly maps. These data cover all of North America (not including Greenland).
- Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration is measured in parts per million (ppm).
- Atmospheric methane (CH₄) concentration is measured in parts per billion (ppb).
- Atmospheric nitrous oxide (N₂O) concentration is measured in parts per billion (ppb)

So, if we don't take any action against ***climate change*** then  With continued carbon emissions, the melting of other ice caps and thermal expansion of the ocean, a multi-metre sea-level rise appears likely.It is bad news for the nearly 600 million people that live in **coastal zones** worldwide. Other major problems that will ocure are:
1. destabilized global food systems
2. habitat loss for polar wildlife
3. Scarcity of fresh water.
